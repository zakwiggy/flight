/******************************************************************************
 This file is a patched version of printf called _printf_P
 It is made to work with avr-gcc for Atmel AVR MCUs.
 There are some differences from standard printf:
 	1. There is no floating point support (with fp the code is about 8K!)
 	2. Return type is void
 	3. Format string must be in program memory (by using macro printf this is
 	   done automaticaly)
 	4. %n is not implemented (just remove the comment around it if you need it)
 	5. If LIGHTPRINTF is defined, the code is about 550 bytes smaller and the
 	   folowing specifiers are disabled :
 		space # * . - + p s o O
	6. A function void uart_sendchar(char c) is used for output. The UART must
		be initialized before using printf.
